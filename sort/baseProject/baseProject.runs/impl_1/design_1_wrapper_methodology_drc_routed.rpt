There is a large setup violation of -36.405 ns between design_1_i/sort_ip_0/U0/sort_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/dataArrayIn_reg[48]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/sort_ip_0/U0/sort_ip_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/axi_rdata_reg[5]_bret__1/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
